# Cookbook

Contained in this repository is various recipes that I've acquired from various sources (family, cookbooks, gourmet, etc.). I hope to eventually have a web-based version of this cookbook to easily share/navigate instead of just the recipe files in the repository.

Right now, the recipes are all .doc files and are as my father organized them. I hope to convert them all to .md files as well as clean up the organization/remove duplicates.
