# Cookbook

Contained in this repository are various recipes that have been acquired from various sources (family, cookbooks, gourmet, etc.). I hope to eventually have a web-based version of this cookbook to easily share/navigate instead of just the recipe files in the repository.

Right now, the recipes are mostly .doc files and are as my father organized them (in the raw_doc_files folder). I hope to convert them all to .md files as well as clean up the organization/remove duplicates.
