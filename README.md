# Family Cookbook

Contained in this repo is various recipes my family uses for various meals across the year. I hope to eventually have a web-based version of this cookbook in addition to this repo.

These recipes come from parents as well as the occasional bon appetit or gourmet recipe.

Right now, the recipes are all .doc files and are as my father organized them. I hope to convert them all to md files as well as clean up the organization/remove duplicates.
