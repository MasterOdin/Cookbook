<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>8 asparagus spears, tough ends trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch lengths <br />
4 oz. green beans, ends trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch lengths <br />
1 red bell pepper, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice <br />
2 heads broccoli, stems removed, cut into small florets <br />
2 T. extra-virgin olive oil <br />
1/2 red onion, finely chopped <br />
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced <br />
Pinch of chile flakes <br />
2 T. rice vinegar <br />
1/4 c. vegetable stock <br />
4 oz. fresh or frozen (and thawed) green peas <br />
Salt and freshly ground black pepper <br />
1 lb. chunky pasta (e.g., fusilli, penne, farfalle) <br />
2 T. butter, softened <br />
Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, set up an ice bath. Plunge the asparagus, beans, bell pepper and broccoli into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds.</li>
<li>Drain, and immediately transfer to the ice bath.</li>
<li>Once the vegetables are chilled, remove them from the ice bath, pat dry on paper towels, and set aside.</li>
<li>Keep the cooking water boiling for the pasta.</li>
<li>In a large saut&eacute; pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat, and add the onion, garlic and chile flakes.</li>
<li>Cook until the onion and garlic are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Increase the heat to medium-high, and stir in the vinegar.</li>
<li>Let the liquid reduce until the pan is nearly dry (this may occur quickly, depending on the weight of your pan), and stir in the stock.</li>
<li>Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, add the peas, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water.</li>
<li>Cook until al dente (about 8 minutes), and drain.</li>
<li>Increase the heat in the saut&eacute; pan to high, and stir in the blanched vegetables.</li>
<li>Toss gently over heat for 30 seconds, add the pasta and butter, and toss again to combine.</li>
<li>Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Fine-Tuning Tips:
* For acidic wines: Substitute feta cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano. 
* For herbaceous wines: Stir in 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley and/or a handful of torn basil leaves with the hot pasta and butter.
* For sweet wines: Replace the broccoli and/or asparagus with more bell pepper.</p>
