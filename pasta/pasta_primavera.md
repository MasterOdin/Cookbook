## Ingredients
8 asparagus spears, tough ends trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch lengths  
4 oz. green beans, ends trimmed, cut into 1/2-inch lengths  
1 red bell pepper, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice  
2 heads broccoli, stems removed, cut into small florets  
2 T. extra-virgin olive oil  
1/2 red onion, finely chopped  
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
Pinch of chile flakes  
2 T. rice vinegar  
1/4 c. vegetable stock  
4 oz. fresh or frozen (and thawed) green peas  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
1 lb. chunky pasta (e.g., fusilli, penne, farfalle)  
2 T. butter, softened  
Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Directions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, set up an ice bath. Plunge the asparagus, beans, bell pepper and broccoli into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds.
3. Drain, and immediately transfer to the ice bath.
4. Once the vegetables are chilled, remove them from the ice bath, pat dry on paper towels, and set aside.
5. Keep the cooking water boiling for the pasta.
6. In a large saut&eacute; pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat, and add the onion, garlic and chile flakes.
7. Cook until the onion and garlic are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
8. Increase the heat to medium-high, and stir in the vinegar.
9. Let the liquid reduce until the pan is nearly dry (this may occur quickly, depending on the weight of your pan), and stir in the stock.
10. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, add the peas, and season with salt and pepper.
11. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water.
12. Cook until al dente (about 8 minutes), and drain.
13. Increase the heat in the saut&eacute; pan to high, and stir in the blanched vegetables.
14. Toss gently over heat for 30 seconds, add the pasta and butter, and toss again to combine.
15. Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano.
16. Serve immediately.

## Notes
Fine-Tuning Tips:
* For acidic wines: Substitute feta cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano. 
* For herbaceous wines: Stir in 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley and/or a handful of torn basil leaves with the hot pasta and butter.
* For sweet wines: Replace the broccoli and/or asparagus with more bell pepper.
